# Train-Scheduler

This app uses Moment.js to calculate train arrival times.

You can enter in the train name, the destination, the first train time, and the frequency in which the train comes.

Once you click the submit the information, the train is added to the table.

The app then uses the first train time that the user entered to calculate when the next arrival is, and how many minutes away the train is.
